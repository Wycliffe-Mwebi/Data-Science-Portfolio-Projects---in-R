# Credit Card Fraud detection
Billions of dollars are lost every year due to fraudulent credit card transactions and data shows that credit card fraud is rising. Therefore there is an urgent need to 
develop new, and improve current, fraud detection methods.The design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is key to reducing these losses, and more algorithms rely on 
advanced machine learning techniques to assist fraud investigators. 
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning algorithm on a dataset to successfully predict fraudulent transactions. For this project I have used a dataset
of European cardholders containing transactions made in the month of september 2013. The dataset is available on Kaggle.
