## Survey of BMI and physical activity
Surveys are often used to study health behavior and determine the risks of disease. Meanwhile, seemingly every day, news outlets publish a different "research says" article about how to lose weight (fast! with no effort at all!). In this project, I will use survey data of ~20k people sampled from the United States to explore health behaviors associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI), a standardized measure of healthy weight and obesity. Surveys with complex designs use special statistical methods to incorporate sampling weights and design factors into the estimation and inference. Incorporating survey design methods, I will use multiple regression to handle confounders when testing whether physical activity is associated with lower BMI. The survey data is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES data includes many measurements related to overall health, physical activity, diet, psychological health, socioeconomic factors and more.
