## Survey of BMI and physical activity
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data is a complex survey of tens of thousands of people designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES data includes many measurements related to overall health, physical activity, diet, psychological health, socioeconomic factors and more.

Depending on the sampling design, each person has a sampling weight that quantifies how many people in the larger population their data is meant to represent. In this notebook, we'll apply survey methods that use sampling weights to estimate and model relationships between measurements.

We are going to focus on a common health indicator, Body Mass Index (BMI kg/m2), and how it is related to physical activity. We'll visualize the data and use survey-weighted regression to test for associations.
