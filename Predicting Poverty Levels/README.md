# Predicting Poverty Levels
### Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction
In order to reduce poverty,social inequalities and address the needs of small and vulnerable countries, we must identify which households have the highest need for social 
welfare assistance? We’re told that often the most needy won’t be able to provide the documentation required of formal applications, so in many ways those who need the most 
help are also those who are least likely to recieve it. 
In this project, I will develop a model to help identify individuals and households that have the greatest need of financial aid. The challenge here then is to use the other 
information we know about individuals and households - features such as their family size, home construction type and their access to adequate sanitation - to help identify 
those individuals most in need before it’s too late. For this project, i will use Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction dataset from the Inter-American Development 
Bank available on kaggle.
