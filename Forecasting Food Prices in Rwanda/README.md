# Forecasting Food Prices in Rwanda
Every time I go to the supermarket, my wallet weeps a little. But how expensive is food around the world? In this project, I will explore time series of food prices in Rwanda from the [United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices). Agriculture makes up over 30% of Rwanda's economy, and over 60% of its export earnings [(CIA World Factbook)](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rw.html), so the price of food is very important to the livelihood of many Rwandans.

In this project, I am going to import, manipulate, visualize and forecast Rwandan potato price data. I will also wrap my analysis into functions to make it easy to analyze prices of other foods.
